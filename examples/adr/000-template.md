# Goals
> * Explain the reasons for creating this Decision Record.
> * What is the end-goal of this document? What should it achieve?
> * _Example: The goal of this document is to choose a database we
    will use to store pictures of cats._

# Non-goals
> * Optional section that describes what will **not** be covered by this document.
> * Used to narrow the scope of the document and clarify its purpose.
> * _Example: This document will not cover the database for storing pictures of dogs._

# Context
> * Explain the situation, motivation, and business priorities.
> * Include rationale and considerations based on the target audience of this document
    (your fellow developers do not need broader context, an external project manager may need to see the bigger picture).
> * _Example: Our company specializes in storing pictures of cats.
>    We have a lot of printed pictures; however, our storage capacity is limited,
>    and we decided to store them in a database [link to this decision]._

# Decision
> * Describe which solution you chose and why.
> * Mostly written in the active voice: "We will…", "We decided to…".
> * _Example: We decided to store pictures in CatDB because it is a specialized database for storing pictures of cats
>    and it offers us a free tier._

# Considered Options
> * Write down possible solutions.
> * Include relevant pros and cons, and describe how they fit with your needs and goals.
> * Use a lot of pictures and diagrams; they help with explanation.

# Consequences
> * Explain what will happen after the decision is made, listing positive and negative aspects. This can include the **effects, outcomes, outputs, follow-ups**, and more.
> * If necessary, add here a need to make other Decision Records, create new requirements, or modify existing requirements.
> * Include any after-action review processes. Typically, compare Decision Record information with what has happened in actual practice, in order to learn and grow.
> * _Example:_
>    * _Good: we will have more storage space._
>    * _Bad: we need to digitalize printed pictures of cats and move them to the DB._
>    * _We do not know how to move pictures of cats from 35mm films; this needs to be discovered in [link to the ticket]._
