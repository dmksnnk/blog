Today we will create our own HTTP/3 client stream to send some sweet-sweet data to the server.

Streaming data from the client can be used for sending large or real-time data uploads, such as file uploads, telemetry, or live feeds. With HTTP/3 and Go, you can efficiently stream request bodies without buffering the entire payload in memory.

## Streaming Client Request

This is similar to streaming a request body in regular HTTP.
We'll use an [`io.Pipe`](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Pipe) to write data from the client as
it becomes available, while the server reads the stream as it arrives.

Here is client code that creates a request and streams data to the server at regular intervals:

```go
pipeR, pipeW := io.Pipe()
req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", "https://localhost:8080/stream", pipeR)
...

// send data to the server in a separate goroutine
// at 100ms intervals and close the request body when done,
// indicating that no more data will be sent
go func() {
  defer req.Body.Close()

  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Fprintf(pipeW, "data chunk #%d\n", i)
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
  }
}()

resp, err := client.Do(req)
...
```

The server part is quite simple: we just read the request body and dump it to the console:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/stream", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // copying the request body to stdout
  io.Copy(os.Stdout, r.Body)
})
```

If we run everything together, we will see the data being printed to the console as it arrives:

```
$ go run bodystream.go
data chunk #0
data chunk #1
data chunk #2
data chunk #3
...
```

You can find the complete code in [bodystream.go](https://github.com/dmksnnk/blog/tree/main/examples/http3/clientstream/bodystream.go).

## Taking Over the Request Stream

We can take full control over the client's request stream.
For this, we need to go a bit lower level and build on top of the QUIC connection.
This allows us to create an HTTP/3 connection, send request headers, and stream data directly over it.

First, we need to create a QUIC connection by dialing the server address:

```go
tlsConf := &tls.Config{
  RootCAs:    certPool,
  NextProtos: []string{http3.NextProtoH3}, // advertise HTTP/3 support
}

qconn, err := quic.DialAddr(context.TODO(), "localhost:8080", tlsConf, nil)
...
```

Then we need to create an HTTP/3 client connection and open a request stream:

```go
tr := &http3.Transport{}
clientConn := tr.NewClientConn(qconn)
stream, err := clientConn.OpenRequestStream(context.TODO())
...
```

Next, we make an HTTP request to the server.
This is where the server can validate the request and allow or deny the request stream:

```go
req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", "https://localhost:8080/stream", http.NoBody)
...
// sending request headers
if err := stream.SendRequestHeader(req); err != nil {
  ... // handle error
}
resp, err := stream.ReadResponse()
if err != nil {
  ... // handle error
}

if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
  ... // handle non-OK response
}
```

And finally, we can write data to the stream in a loop, simulating a client that sends data in chunks:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  fmt.Fprintf(stream, "data chunk #%d\n", i)
  time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
}
```

The server can then read the data directly from the HTTP/3 stream.
See [Overtaking HTTP/3 Stream](/blog/http3/server-stream/#overtaking-http3-stream) for more details on how to do this:

```go
mux.HandleFunc("/stream", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // responding with 200 OK header
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
  // taking over the HTTP/3 stream
  streamer := w.(http3.HTTPStreamer)
  http3Stream := streamer.HTTPStream()
  defer http3Stream.Close()
  // dumping the stream to stdout
  io.Copy(os.Stdout, http3Stream)
})
```

See [requeststream.go](https://github.com/dmksnnk/blog/tree/main/examples/http3/clientstream/requeststream.go) for the full example.

Congratulations on reaching this far! You are fabulous! âœ¨

## Recap

In this post, we learned how to stream data from a client to an HTTP/3 server in Go, both with the standard library and with direct stream control.
